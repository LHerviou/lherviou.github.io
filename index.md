<div style="text-align: justify" markdown="1"> My name is Marta Brzezińska and I am a data scientist/machine learning expert at precision medicine biotech [Novigenix SA](https://novigenix.com/).

Before, I was a postdoctoral researcher in computational condensed matter physics at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). I obtained my PhD in Physics under the supervision of [Prof. Arkadiusz Wójs](https://arkadiuszwojs.pwr.edu.pl/) and [Prof. Titus Neupert](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/neupert/team/neupert.html). My research interests included topological states of matter. You can find my thesis on [GitHub](https://github.com/martabrz/PhDThesis) and all articles on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d2azi6kAAAAJ).


<!-- I have a strong theoretical background and high-performance computing experience. I am familiar with scientific stacks in **Python** (Numpy, SciPy, Cython, Pandas, Jupyter) and C++ (Eigen, Armadillo), **parallel computing** with MPI and OpenMP, and **machine learning** libraries (Tensorflow, PyTorch, scikit-learn). I am well-versed in numerical methods, including machine learning, exact diagonalization, tensor networks, density functional theory, and quantum computing. -->
