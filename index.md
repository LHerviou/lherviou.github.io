<img src="profile.jpg" height="250px"> My name is Marta Brzezińska and I am a postdoctoral researcher in Computational Condensed Matter Physics Group (C3MP) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland.

I obtained my PhD in Physics under the supervision of Prof. [Arkadiusz Wójs](https://arkadiuszwojs.pwr.edu.pl/) and [Prof. Titus Neupert](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/neupert/team/neupert.html). You can find my thesis entitled *Beyond the ten-fold way: novel topological phases in low-dimensional systems* [here](https://github.com/martabrz/PhDThesis). My research interests include topological states of matter, non-Hermitian physics, and machine learning methods for materials sciences. Recent articles can be found on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Brzezi%C5%84ska%2C+M) and [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d2azi6kAAAAJ).

I have a strong theoretical background and high-performance computing experience. I am familiar with scientific stacks in **Python** (Numpy, SciPy, Cython, Pandas, Jupyter) and C++ (Eigen, Armadillo), **parallel computing** with MPI and OpenMP, and **machine learning** libraries (Tensorflow, PyTorch, scikit-learn). I am well-versed in numerical methods, including machine learning, exact diagonalization, tensor networks, density functional theory, and quantum computing.

Hobbies: fencing, guitar, video games.
