<!-- ![](profile.jpg){:height="250px"} -->

My name is Marta and I'm currently working in Computational Condensed Matter Physics Group at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. I like using computers to understand the nature of electrons in crystal systems. I also enjoy spending time on figuring out how to perform computations in the most efficient way, so high-performance computing and computer hardware are part of my interests.  

In the free time, I play the guitar and listen to 80s music.
