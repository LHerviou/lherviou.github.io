<div style="text-align: justify" markdown="1">
I currently propose two master internships (M2) in theory of condensed matter, cosupervised by two colleagues at LPMMC. To formally apply, please send me a brief email presenting yourself, including your CV, your grades of the previous year/semester and any reports you made for previous internships. If you have recommendation letters, it is a plus, but not mandatory.

Feel free to send me an email should you be interested by something else than what is presented below (or a PhD/postdoc position). I am always happy to talk about physics.
